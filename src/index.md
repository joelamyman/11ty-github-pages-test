This site is a demonstration of how we could use GitHub Pages + 11ty for publishing our team's content.

This page has been generated using 11ty to combine a markdown file (containing this content) with a templated page structure. This means we can add resources in markdown and have them automatically wrapped with our accessible theme, creating a light-weight static site that we have control over.
