<p>This site is a demonstration of how we could use GitHub Pages + 11ty for publishing our team's content.</p>

<p>This page has been generated using 11ty to combine a markdown file (containing this content) with a templated page structure. This means we can add resources in markdown and have them automatically wrapped with our accessible theme, creating a light-weight static site that we have control over.</p>

<h2>Recent posts</h2>

<p>Below are some of our recent posts, <a href="{{ '/blog/' | url }}">more content can be found on the blog</a>.</p>
